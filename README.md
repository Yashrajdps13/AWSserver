# AMS -Attendance Management System

The **Attendance Management System** integrates facial recognition technology to simplify attendance tracking in educational institutions. This comprehensive solution optimizes the process of marking attendance, enhancing efficiency. The documentation meticulously explains the application's features, functionality, and technical intricacies, providing a thorough understanding of its operation. Through seamless integration of facial recognition, the system offers a reliable and efficient method for monitoring attendance, contributing to smoother administrative processes within educational settings.

## Scope

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a user-centric attendance marking application in two distinct phases. In Phase 1, the application will offer virtual attendance marking service, also ensuring the student’s presence in class, thus automating the repetitive tedious work of taking attendance in every class. Phase 2 will introduce a dashboard section, where the professor can upload messages,notices or assessments for the students.

## Objectives

## The primary objectives of this project are outlined below:
 - ## From Professor’s End:
   -Professors will be able to create classrooms and schedule classes.
   
   -They can create short windows within the period timings in which the students will be able to mark their attendance.
   
   -They will have access of attendance records of each student they are teaching.
   
   -Professors can also manually mark attendance of students in case of emergency or error in recognition by the Machine 
    Learning Model.
   
 - ## From Student’s End:
   -Students can join the classroom created by the professors of their respective subjects.
   
   -Students will be able to mark their attendance using the facial recognition model.
   
   -They will be able to check their attendance percentage in each subject.
